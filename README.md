# PHP Instant Gallery

--

### About:
This project was created because I found it very frustrating that I couldn't find a useful open source PHP gallery that would just work and didn't require a lot of fiddling to show pictures and videos in a directory.
The idea here is that all you need to do is point this at a directory and it will generate the thumbnails and then show you the pictures.  If you have a directory with hundreds or thousands of pictures, it will take a bit for the script to generate all the thumbnails.

It's still a work in progress, and I'll add more documentation once I have productionalized the thing.
