# PHP Instant Gallery

## About:
This project was created because I found it very frustrating that I couldn't find a useful open source PHP gallery that would just work and didn't require a lot of fiddling to show pictures and videos in a directory.
The idea here is that all you need to do is point this at a directory and it will generate the thumbnails and then show you the pictures.  If you have a directory with hundreds or thousands of pictures, it will take a bit for the script to generate all the thumbnails.

It's still a work in progress, and I'll add more documentation once I have productionalized the thing.

## Features
- Supports image file formats (jpg,jpeg,png,gif,webp,bmp,ico,apng)
- Supports video file formats (mp4,webm,ogg,ogv,3gp,qt,mov,qtff,avi)
- Supports audio file formats (mp3,opus,wav,flac,aac)
- Integrated video and audio player
- Integrated PDF viewer
- Visiting gallery autogenerates thumbnails for all images, videos, audio and PDF in gallery directory
- Resizeable thumbnail size reorders images
- Sort media Ascending/Descending by: modified date, date taken, size, name
- Filter Media by file type and grouping
- Lightbox viewer with button, arrow key and touch navigation
- Shows image and video metadata (including GPS data with Google Maps link integrated)

## How to use:
1. Copy index.php to directory above where gallery of media is.
2. Change `$base_dir` to media directory
3. Change `$thumbs_dir` to directory where thumbnails will be stored
4. (Optional) Update `$ffmpeg_path` and `$ffprobe_path` to the right location if they aren't on the system path already.
5. (Optional) Update `$show_gps_coords` to true if you want to show google map links on images
5. (Optional) Add `'Display Name' => 'path/to/directory',` for each wanted sub-directory to navigate to [still experimental, be warned]
6. (Optional) Add `'Google' => 'https://google.com',` for each external link you want to add to the page.

Done!
